# Carillon: Billing (Stripe) setup & sandbox testing

> **Model superseded: see [BILLING_MODEL.md](BILLING_MODEL.md).** Carillon no longer sells a recurring subscription with a 7-day trial. The current model is a **prepaid credit pool**, billed **per service** (1 credit = 2 € = one service-month), refilled **only in 5-credit packs** (€10), with magic-link accounts and one free credit. The Stripe *operational* steps below stay useful once re-pointed at **one-shot `payment`-mode Checkout** with a one-time **pack** Price (the `pack` key). The subscription description below is kept only for historical context.

Carillon sells **one flat subscription per account** (the `standard` plan, e.g. **€3/month**) covering **every mailbox** the account watches, unlimited up to a fair-use cap (`[server] max_watches_per_account`, default 25). The price lives in **Stripe** (a recurring Price object), never in code. Payment is stateless on our side: Stripe owns the customer and receipt; we persist only the subscription *state* Stripe reports (status + period end). Every account starts with a **7-day free trial** (a generic free period, so it extends to non-IMAP services later).

Provider is chosen by config: no `[billing.stripe]` selects the keyless **stub** (dev); `[billing.stripe]` present selects the real **Stripe** adapter.

## Which keys, and where they go

| Key | Looks like | Where | Needed? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Secret key** | `sk_test_…` / `sk_live_…` | server config `[billing.stripe] secret_key` | **yes** |
| **Webhook signing secret** | `whsec_…` | server config `[billing.stripe] webhook_secret` | **yes** |
| **Publishable key** | `pk_test_…` | - | **no** |

We use Stripe **hosted Checkout** (we redirect the buyer to a Stripe-hosted page), so the **publishable key is unused server-side**. You would only need it in the *admin* front (`VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`) if you later embed Stripe Elements/embedded checkout in the dashboard.

> Production: inject `secret_key` / `webhook_secret` via systemd `LoadCredential` or a secrets manager, **not** a world-readable carillon.toml (see DEPLOY_HARDENING.md §2).

## One-time Stripe dashboard setup (sandbox)

1. Create a Stripe account: it starts in **Test mode**. Keep the "Test mode" toggle **on** for all of the below (test keys/prices are separate from live).
2. **Products → Prices**: create **one product** with a **recurring** Price in your currency, e.g. "Carillon" at **€3 billed monthly**. Copy its **Price id** (`price_…`).
3. **Developers → API keys**: copy the **Secret key** (`sk_test_…`).
4. **Settings → Billing → Customer portal**: activate the portal (once) so the Manage / Cancel button works.

Put them in carillon.toml (the price key must be `standard`):

```toml
[billing.stripe]
secret_key = "sk_test_…"
webhook_secret = "whsec_…"                 # from step below

[billing.stripe.prices]
standard = "price_…"                        # €3/month (recurring)
```

`success_url` / `cancel_url` are **optional**: where Stripe returns the browser after checkout. Left unset they default to your `dashboard_url` (or `public_url`) with a `?checkout=success` / `?checkout=cancel` marker, fine for local testing.

---

## Getting the webhook secret

**Local dev, Stripe CLI (recommended):**

```sh
stripe login
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/billing/webhook
```

`stripe listen` prints `whsec_…`: put it in `webhook_secret`. It forwards real test events to your local server, correctly signed. No public URL needed.

**Deployed server, dashboard endpoint:** Developers → Webhooks → *Add endpoint* → URL `https://your-server/billing/webhook`, events **`checkout.session.completed`**, **`customer.subscription.updated`** and **`customer.subscription.deleted`**. Copy that endpoint's signing secret (`whsec_…`).

---

## Testing the full flow

1. Start the server: `carillon-backend serve carillon.toml` (logs `billing: stripe`).
2. If local: keep `stripe listen …` running in another terminal.
3. Start a checkout (through the dashboard, or by hand with a capability link):

   ```sh
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/billing/checkout \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <capability-link>" \
     -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{}'
   ```

   (No body needed: one flat plan.) Returns `{"provider":"stripe","checkout_url":"https://checkout.stripe.com/…", …}`.
4. Open `checkout_url`, subscribe with a **test card**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`, any future expiry, any CVC/ZIP.
5. Stripe fires `checkout.session.completed` → `/billing/webhook` → signature verified → subscription bound to the account and activated. Server logs `subscription activated`.
6. Verify: `GET /me` shows `balance.subscribed` `true`, `balance.status` `active`, `balance.current_period_end` set.
7. In the Stripe **customer portal** (via the dashboard's Manage button, or the portal URL from `POST /billing/portal`), cancel the subscription → `customer.subscription.updated`/`deleted` → `/billing/webhook` → status flips to `canceled`; the entitlement sweep pauses the account's watches when the period (plus a short grace) ends.

### Notes
- `stripe trigger checkout.session.completed` alone won't activate anything: a triggered event has no `client_reference_id`, so it's (correctly) **ignored**. Real activation needs an actual checkout so our session id round-trips.
- Activation is **idempotent**: Stripe retries the webhook; the second one is ignored (the session is already fulfilled).
- A forged/expired/wrong-secret signature is rejected with **400** (unit-tested in billing.rs).
- Going live: swap `sk_test_…`/`whsec_…`/`price_…` for their live equivalents and activate the account. Nothing else changes.
